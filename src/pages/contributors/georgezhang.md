Long time ago, I learned my first [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) language in late 90's when I was a college student. I still remember the black screen with a few lines codings could do some amazing calculations quite similar to the calculator. Since then, I learned c and later c++. However, soon after I took my first job, I learned IBM RPG which ran on a machine called AS400 which was quite a bit boring. So I decided move on to C# and SQL. Soon web 2.0 was booming which attracted me to learn Javascript. It is a long journey......

I lived in a few amazing cities before. I used to live in a small town in west Michigan that was full of European culture and I liked the people in the town. I moved to Seattle in Washinton state and live there for a few years. Now I settled in Edmonton Canada as my home. Edmonton has nice weather in Summer but cold in Winter. So far I am still enjoying here.

I traveled a lot of places in north America. I had been to Washinton D.C., Florida, Vancouver...... Now I want to have a long vacation in Hawaii that I havn't been there yet. I also want to go to Japan since I want to know their culture. My friend told me Brazil also has a big area of rain forest which I want to have a look either.

Maybe there are lots of fun in the world waiting for me to explore!!!
