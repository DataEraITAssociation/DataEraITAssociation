ARC (formerly EZ-Builder) includes Blockly Programming for both Windows and Mobile editions.

We recommend that users who are new to programming start with RoboScratch before moving to Blockly.

​While both languages offer drag-and-drop functionality, Blockly is less linear and includes logic functions like "If Conditions", "Loops" and "Variables"

Once you have become comfortable with RoboScratch, moving to Blockly is the next step on your programming adventure!
​

In the Mobile Edition, you will find Blockly in the main menu screen, once you launch a project.
Step 1

Before using Blockly, load your robot project into ARC. This will populate the Blocks with information specifically related to your project.

Step 2

Load the Blockly Interface. Depending on whether you are running ARC on Mobile or Windows, the steps will vary as follows:
In Windows, the Blockly UI can be found in the Top Menu next to RoboScratch and the Virtual Desktops.

Step 3

Begin building a program!

Blockly makes programming easier that text-based programming because you never worry about spelling mistakes or incorrect syntax. The focus of Block programming is to learn logic of Loops, IF conditions and Variables.

What's Next?

Once you have become comfortable with Blockly, the next step is learning Syntax Programming using EZ-Script, JavaScript, or Pyton. Continue to the next lesson of the Activities Guide and begin learning how to create powerful programs with text-based programming.
